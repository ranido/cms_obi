"""A class to update a dump created by CMS.

Used by DumpImporter and DumpUpdater.

This is a fake updater that warns about a change in the way Java
submissions are compiled. This applies only to batch tasks with no
grader (as it was the only task type supporting Java). The difference
is that before the public class submitted by contestant had to be
named "Task", whereas now it must be called with the task short name.
