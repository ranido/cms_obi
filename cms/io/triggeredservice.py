    This is a base class implementing a common pattern in CMS: a
    service performing operations when certain conditions are met.

    Often, the operation is "do something on object x" and the
    condition is a condition on the fields of object x, but this
    pattern is not included in this class, the operation have no need
    to be in that form.

    The pattern is implemented through the following blocks.
    - The method enqueue, which schedules a new operation. This can be
      used by subclasses when they receive a notification that an
      operations is needed, or in any other contexts.
    - A sweeper greenlet that asks subclasses to search and enqueue
      operations that were missed by the previous step.
    - A list of executors (each running in its own greenlet), each of
      which takes care of performing all operations.

    Note that if there are multiple executors, each operation will be
    executed by all of them. Indeed, having multiple executors is
    required when we need to execute slightly different versions of
    the same operation depending on local variables in the
    executors. For example, sending data to different machines.

    If required, subclasses can override enqueue() to change this
    behavior, for example to dispatch different operations to
    different executors.
