"""Priority queue used in triggered services.

This file implements a greenlet-safe priority queue to be used as the
operation queue for triggered services. External clients can use the
queue to store QueueItems (which should be subclassed). No duplicate
items can be stored in the queue

Since the queue provides the ability of changing priorities and
removing arbtrary items, the QueueItems must be hashable, as they are
used in a reverse lookup array.

The priority is given by two fields: priority, which is an integer
among the PRIORITY_classes defined in PriorityQueue, and timestamp,
which is supposed to be the timestamp in which the operation was
requested for the first time. Timestamp is only used to discern
between entries with the same priority.

The queue stores entries in the QueueEntry format, a class that stores
together the three data point: item, priority, and timestamp.
