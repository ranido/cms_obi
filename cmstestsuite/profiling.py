"""Profiling utils for the testsuites.

There are several Python profilers out there, but many of them have problems,
are not maintained, or are not greenlet-aware. We selected two that work
reasonably well: yappi (`pip install yappi`,
https://bitbucket.org/sumerc/yappi/) and kernprof (`pip install line_profiler`,
https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler).

Yappi was developed exactly due to the missing multithreading support of the
official profilers, and is designed for long-running applications (as are CMS'
services). After running a test with yappi enabled, .prof files will be
generated for each service, and they can be inspected with pstats or the handy
cprofilev, or with kcachegrind using `pip install pyprof2calltree` and
`pyprof2calltree -i output.prof -k`.

Kernprof offers instead a greenlet-aware line profiler whose output might be
easier to understand than yappi's, but requires @profile annotations on
functions or methods. The output will be in .lprof files, that can be inspected
using `python -m line_profile output.lprof`
